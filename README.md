#  Corporate Website redesign

This is my attempt (in progress) at redesigning a corporate website using React.

Original for reference is here: sageretirement.com.au
The original was built with Wordpress

Rebuilding this website with React helped me to learn new concepts such as:
- React Router for navigation
- visual asset design via affinity designer/figma
- design concepts like glassmorphism and claymorphism
- React animations via Framer Motion (yet to be incorporated)
